       We lay the cards upside down in the practical memory game and pick out two cards at a time. If both cards match, we remove those cards from the layout. Otherwise, cards are put back in their original upside-down state. The winner will be the one pulling out all the matching pairs. You need to finish the game in the 40s. Keep the timer countdown in mind. Good luck!
